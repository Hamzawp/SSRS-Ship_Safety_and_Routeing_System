## About The Project

<details>
  <summary>Development of a versatile algorithm for optimal ship routing in the Indian Ocean, optimizing for fuel consumption, voyage time, safety, and other parameters, using real-time weather data and ship characteristics, with potential to expand optimization features</summary>
  <br/>
- Optimizing a ship's route and speed can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 48â€“60% and can save billions of dollars.<br/>
- Our algorithm utilizes the CMEMS(ocean dataset) for getting precise marine information and ocean conditions along with the accurate International Ports data after consulting with experienced marine officers.<br/>
- The application allows ship captains to adjust routes based on cost or fuel optimization for a customized path. <br/>
- Our solution's algorithm self-improves using past ship incidents, becoming smarter in suggesting the most efficient routes.
